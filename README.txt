This is a list of the required Python modules for using this package.


math: Standard Python lib
numpy and scipy:  Available at http://www.scipy.org/SciPy
  SciPy depends on numpy.  Both can be gotten from the above site.  There are
  install instructions for most major linux distributions.
  SciPy requires a linear algebra library like (BLAS and LAPACK), but the
  recomended lib is ATLAS.
MySQLdb: Available through links at http://mysql-python.sourceforge.net/
  This will require that you have the development libraries for mysql.  On
  Redhat this will be an RPM like mysql-devel.  You can also get the devel
  package directly from the MySQL web site (www.mysql.com).
  The above site also has links to the documentation, if needed.
